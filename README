RealBoy is a Free, Fast, Yet Accurate, Game Boy/Game Boy Color Emulator for Linux/Unix.
It has both technical as well as educational goals.

Technically, it aims for the following:

1) Accuracy. Perhaps the most important technical goal, as seen in the best closed-sourced emulators, such as KiGB and BGB, and some free emulators, such as Gambatte and MESS.
2) Performance. Show that it is possible to implement a very fast emulator without sacrificing accuracy.
3) Feature-rich. Implement advanced features such as a flexible internal debugger.

Besides the technical goals, RealBoy pretends to serve as an education tools; it includes a set of documentation files describing the design and implementation issues found while developing the emulator. This can be found on RealBoy's official website (realboyemulator.wordpress.com). We hope the documentation can be useful to individuals that would like to learn about how emulators work in general, and the type of problems you face when implementing a fully-functional emulator project.


Features
--------
RealBoy is a work in progress; current features include:

- Accuracy: Pass various test ROMS designed to evaluate the accuracy of a Game Boy emulator, including: CPU Instructions, Instructions' Timings and Memory Access Timings.

- Performance: For 64-bit versions of the x86 architecture (a.k.a x86_64, a.k.a amd64), an Assembly Language version of the emulator's core is provided, significantly faster than the C version.

- Support for MBC1, MBC3 and MBC5.
- Support for RTC (Real Time Clock) in MBC3.
- Support for executing the original boot ROMS (files not included for legal reasons).
- Internal Debugger: Basic functionality such as adding breakpoints, printing registers, etc.
- FPS: User control over framerate (default is 60fps).
- Sound: Implemented channels 1, 2 and 4.
- Video: Scaling to 2x, 3x and 4x, with or without fullscreen.
- Video: Antialiasing.
- RealBoy Internals: Design and implementation documentation.


Compiling the sources
---------------------
RealBoy is distributed with Autotools-derived scripts, so compiling is just a matter of the well-known ./configure && make process. There are some RealBoy-specific arguments you can pass to configure:

./configure --disable-asm (Force compiling the C instead of Assembly code for x86_64 architectures. By default, the configure script chooses the Assembly sources automatically on these processors.)


System requirements
-------------------

- POSIX-compliant Operating System (Linux, *BSD, Mac OS X, Solaris, etc)
- SDL library (Generally installed from your packet manager, or download and compile from source from http://www.libsdl.org)


Key combinations during emulation
---------------------------------
The following is the default key bindings:
- Key 'Enter': Start
- Key 'a': Select
- Key 'd': A
- Key 's': B

Anytime during emulation the following also applies:
- Key '1': Video scale 1x
- Key '2': Video scale 2x
- Key '3': Video scale 3x
- Key '4': Video scale 4x
- Key '5': Enable/disable antialiasing
- Key '6': Enable/disable fullscreen
- Key '7': Stop execution and launch GDDB debugger
- Key 'Esc': Quit RealBoy


Configuration Directory
-------
When executed for the first time, RealBoy will create the directory '.realboy' in the user's home directory.
Here RealBoy creates and maintains save files.
In the future this directory will also hold a configuration file.


Boot ROMS
-------
Both Game Boy and Game Boy Color execute a small program at startup (the moment when you power on the console). RealBoy is able to start emulation from here but, for legal reasons, don't include the boot files and skip their execution by default.
If you are feeling nostalgic and want to use the boot ROMS, first you must get them somewhere (they can easily be found by googling). Next you must go to the Configuration Directory created by RealBoy in your home directory ('.realboy'), create a directory named 'boot_roms' and copy the files over there (Game Boy boot ROM must be called 'dmg_boot.bin'; Game Boy Color boot ROM must be called 'gbc_boot.bin'. Finally, when executing RealBoy, the parameter '-b' must be passed in order to tell RealBoy to attempt executing the boot ROM.
